After thinking about if I should use [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for my Freedom Project I was very hesitant. 
I love 3D Models and would love to make something with them, but that was the problem.
I had no clue what I wanted to make and Babylon.js requires you to know how to make 3D Models using things like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
This means I woul dhave to learn how to make a 3D Model in Blender as well as learn Babylon.js and I didn't even know what kind of project I should do so I decided to not use Babylon.
After that I thought about a problem I have and what could solve it. What came to mind was games, I play a lot of games but they become hard to manage from day to day.
Each day has a different dungeon or boss I have to fight on that specific day and it's annoying trying to figure out what day I can do them on.
With this I thought I would make a web based tool to help me keep track of all the grinding I need to do on a daily basis, but I didn't know which tool to use. 
After looking through many tools I decided that [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) would be perfect. At first I didn't know what Firebase could offer but this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag) showed me what Firebase really offered.
Being able to control the back end and allow users to log on with ease is ideal for what I want to create. 
I want users to be able to login and keep track of what they have to do on a specific day and firebase allows me to do so.
I began to research more on Firebase and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UOkri_WNWQ) helped me set up Firebase.
At this point I know what I want to make but I don't know how it should look like so I want to begin on my user interface first then slowly move on to a login screen since Firebase allows users to easily sign in using google.
