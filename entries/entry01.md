I have decided to use Babylon.js as my tool for Javascript. After comparing A-Frame to Babylon.js I felt that Babylon.js would provide more utility for what I want to do. 
A-frame is more based on VR experience and while they do have 3D aspects it's not what I am ultimately looking for. Babylon.js on the other hand has much more of what I am looking.
Babylon.js has a playground where you can test things out as well as many community creations that look very interesting so I ended up choosing Babylon. I am hoping to make a interactive 3D
model or show a bunch of 3D models that are rendered.
